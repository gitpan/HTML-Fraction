NAME
    HTML::Fraction - Encode fractions as HTML entities

SYNOPSIS
      my $fraction = HTML::Fraction->new;
      print $fraction->tweak($html);
  
DESCRIPTION
    The HTML::Fraction encodes fractions as HTML entities. Some very commond
    fractions have HTML entities (eg 1/2 is &frac12;). Additionally, common
    vulgar fractions have Unicode characters (eg 1/5 is &#8533;). This
    module takes a string and encodes fractions as entities: this means that
    it will look pretty in the browser.

    Fractions that are supported: 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1/3, 2/3, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5,
    4/5, 1/6, 5/6, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8 and 7/8.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    The constructor takes no arguments:

      my $fraction = HTML::Fraction->new;

METHODS
  tweak
    Encode the fractions in the HTML as HTML entities:

      print $fraction->tweak($html);
